1) All country/species combinations for which NSR call did not result in N or Ne were manually reviewed. Note that this only applies for species with 10 or more occurrence records.
2) This manual review was based on:
* Review of photos (in the case of iNaturalist data)
* Distribution descriptions (predominantly from the IUCN Red List (version 2024-1), the NCL (Hunt 2006) and The Cactus Family (Anderson 2001))
* Biogeography (e.g. records in a single mountain rangein a neighboring country where the species has not been explicitly recorded)
* Geographic outliers (e.g. cultivated records, singletons far from the bulk of observations)
3) When significant uncertainty about the range of species was encountered, all country/species combinations underwent review (e.g. Epiphyllum phyllanthus).
4) Some species were marked for exclusion from further analyses:
* Species for which the native range is very uncertain were removed (Lophocereus marginatus, Opuntia aciculata, O. cochenillifera, O. dejecta, O. ficus-indica, O. stricta, Selenicereus undatus).
* Rhipsalis baccifera was removed entirely as occurrence records from its native range in Africa were excluded.
